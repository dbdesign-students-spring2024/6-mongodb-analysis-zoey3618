Under Archsense Apartments and ArchSense Barcelona brands, we are a young and dynamic company that is dedicated to personalized management of tourist apartments and houses in two diferent areas in Spain. In Barcelona (Catalunya) and Pontevedra (Galicia).  Our management comprises different phases, from the initial search of clients, reception and accommodation in the apartment until his departure. We also take care of the apartment all clean and conditioning time, and to resolve any issues that may arise during a guest's stay. The main goal of our management is twofold:  - Provide the owner a full service under which you can forget about the worries and concerns the operation of holiday rental, knowing that the investment in the business will bring greater benefits than the option of "traditional" rent. - Get the highest customer satisfaction, ensuring their comfort, in order to make your stay in our apartments result in all the most pleasant time possible.  Our differences with other organizations dedicated to the tourist apartment sector lies in providing special pampering to the customer, feeling to be at their own home and have at all the time a "friend" of reference in the city. This person (me or some of my collaborators) speaks your language, and will help you to solve any questions or problems and looking for suggestions of leisure in the city.  All this expertise has allowed us to grow gradually, as the viral marketing has proven to be our best advertising tool, and thus many customers and many others have repeated recommend us to their family and friends. As an architect, different owners have also recommended us to their friends to transform their properties for holiday apartments. | within an hour     | 100%               | 100%                 | t                 | https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/5f1ceb84-aa15-4eb2-af60-5faa046e9a88.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small | https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/5f1ceb84-aa15-4eb2-af60-5faa046e9a88.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium | Vila de Gràcia                  | 3                   | 15                        | ['email', 'phone', 'work_email'] | t                    | t                      | Barcelona, Spain                      | la Vila de Gràcia                            | Gràcia                       | 41.39877    | 2.15887     | Entire rental unit          | Entire home/apt | 4            |           | 1 bath         |          | 2    | []        | $120.00 | 4              | 180            | 2                      | 7                      | 30                     | 1125                   | 4.4                    | 831.8                  |                  | t                | 0               | 19              | 24              | 129              | 2023/12/14            | 244               | 44                    | 2                      | 2011/12/5    | 2023/12/11  | 4.71                 | 4.81                   | 4.8                       | 4.77                  | 4.81                        | 4.88                   | 4.71                | HUTB-004315 | t                | 1                              | 1                                           | 0                                            | 0                                           | 1.67              |

Other Gaudi attractions can be reached by metro. The nearest Metro station is Paral.lel (5-8 minutes by walk from the flat) where you have 2 Metro lines (the L2 green and L3 violet) which take you within a short time to other interesting places of Barcelona. In this station you can also take the cableway to the top of the Montjuïc to visit the castle.<br /><br />If you come to Barcelona for a congress or to the trade-fair you will be within 15 minutes by walk or 10 minutes by metro at Fira and the Congress Palace in the Avenida Reina Maria Cristina. In the area you can also find little shops and quite an awesome selection of nice bars and restaurants. | https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-214970/original/62d29116-494a-43f2-ae5a-a4030d076a89.jpeg | 1110014 | https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/1110014 | Janeth         | 2011/9/4   | Barcelona, Spain | Here just a couple of guest's evaluations about my flat and myself: "Regarding the accommodation conditions, the apartment was absolutely impeccable. Very clean, a good endowed kitchen, good wireless internet link. The location of the apartment is also good. Situated in a quiet zone, the Para-lel metro station is easy to reach (about 5 min walking), and you can get the Montjuic Park in no time. Regarding the owner, Janet, she's a very nice person that could give tips about the tourist locations, markets etc. Very important: Janet is a very discreet person. I warmly recommend the Janet's apartment. We thank you again for your help. "  "We were absolutely lucky by selecting this accomodation!I have nothing to complaint for at all. The flat was stylish, good equiped with quiet environment and the landlady was very kind and helpful. And of course the price was acceptable too. It´s only 5 min. walking to the nearest metro station, so you can get anywhere quite quickly. I would definitely recommend this accomodation to a friend." | within a day       | 75%                | 33%                  | f                 | https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/2e0c69dc-c348-41e2-b836-61cc3ef2fe44.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small | https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/2e0c69dc-c348-41e2-b836-61cc3ef2fe44.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium | El Poble-sec                    | 1                   | 1                         | ['email', 'phone']               | t                    | t                      | Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain           | el Poble Sec                                 | Sants-Montjuïc               | 41.37042    | 2.16411     | Private room in rental unit | Private room    | 1            |           | 1 shared bath  |          | 1    | []        | $35.00  | 7              | 90             | 5                      | 7                      | 90                     | 90                     | 7                      | 90                     |                  | t                | 22              | 52              | 82              | 357              | 2023/12/14            | 155               | 0                     | 0                      | 2012/6/13    | 2022/10/31  | 4.66                 | 4.82                   | 4.92                      | 4.74                  | 4.69                        | 4.69                   | 4.75                |             | f                | 1                              | 0                                           | 1                                            | 0                                           | 1.11              |

Sants is a very local neighborhood, with stores, market and supermarkets very close, and charming places, such as Plaza de Osca, full of restaurants and bars with very good value for money, full of local people! ;)<br /><br />The apartment is very well connected. The metro and buses are a 5min walk away, with access to L1 and L5, which allows you to reach the city center in 10min (L1), places of interest such as the Sagrada Familia (L5) and the beach (D20). There is also the Sants train station (the main station of the city) and the metro L3 (Park Güell, Gracia, Poble Sec,...) at 10min walking distance. Sants station connects with the airport and places of interest such as Sitges (20-25min). The apartment is a 10min walk from Plaça Espanya, where the Aerobus is, and 5min from the Railway station (FFCC) to go to Montserrat. Very good connection with the airport, 15-20min by cab (no traffic), 30mi | https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/8587f3ba-ce9b-44a4-9688-73db270ca61b.jpg | 874133  | https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/874133  | Barbara        | 2011/7/26  | Barcelona, Spain | I love travelling and experience new cultures. I've been in South America and many countries in Europe. I lived in Finland during 6 month during my last year of University. Due to my work as an infectious diseases researcher, I lived in Brasil (in Manaus, Amazonia) during 2 years, and in California USA, for 2 other years. I also had a nomad lifestyle, coming and going from Barcelona to Papua New Guinea, during the last 3 years prior to the pandemic.   During my PhD in Barcelona, I used Airbnb and shared my apartment with travellers. Most reviews in my host profile are from that time. It was a very nice experience. Nowadays, I have to be mostly based in Barcelona (due to the difficulty to travel due to COVID-19 pandemic), and some of my research projects in the tropics are on hold. So I decided to activate my host profile again, to share my apartment temporarly with people looking for short stays in Barcelona, interested in a home-like housing. In summer, or when my field work is re-activated, I might leave the city for few motnhs and rent the full apartment. | N/A                | N/A                | 77%                  | t                 | https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/874133/profile_pic/1316041786/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small | https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/874133/profile_pic/1316041786/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium | Sants-Montjuïc                  | 1                   | 1                         | ['email', 'phone']               | t                    | t                      | Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain           | Sants                                        | Sants-Montjuïc               | 41.37364    | 2.13906     | Entire loft                 | Entire home/apt | 4            |           | 2 baths        |          | 2    | []        |         | 31             | 96             | 31                     | 31                     | 96                     | 96                     | 31                     | 96                     |                  |                  | 0               | 0               | 0               | 0                | 2023/12/14            | 61                | 12                    | 0                      | 2011/12/27   | 2023/10/2   | 4.81                 | 4.83                   | 4.59                      | 4.88                  | 4.9                         | 4.62                   | 4.76                | Exempt      | f                | 1                              | 1                                           | 0                                            | 0                                           | 0.42              |

## Part 1: Data selection and import

```javascript
mongoimport --headerline --type=csv --db=airbnb --collection=listings --host=127.0.0.1 --file="C:\Users\onepiece\Desktop\listings.csv" 
// Is the full path to the csv file
```

After the import is successful, you will be prompted with how many documents have been successfully imported. At the same time, use mongo compass to see listings in the corresponding db with the same number of documents.

![image-20240407200147289](/data/assess/image-20240407200147289.png)

![image-20240407200428956](/data/assess/image-20240407200428956.png)



## Part 2: Data analysis in MongoDB

Go to the command line console

```javascript
mongo 
// Enter mongo and press enter to enter the console:
```

![image-20240407200719508](/data/assess/image-20240407200719508.png)

Select to the specified db

```javascript
use airbnb 
// Switch to the specified database
```

1. show exactly two documents from the `listings` collection in any order

```javascript
db.listings.find({}).limit(2);
// limit 2
```

![image-20240407200826594](/data/assess/image-20240407200826594.png)

2. show exactly 10 documents in any order, but "prettyprint" in easier to read format, using the `pretty()` function.

```javascript
db.listings.find({}).limit(10).pretty();
// The output is displayed in the specified format
```

![image-20240407201204852](/data/assess/image-20240407201204852.png)

3. choose two hosts (by reffering to their host_id values) who are superhosts (available in the host_is_superhost field), and show all of the listings offered by both of the two hosts
   - only show the `name`, `price`, `neighbourhood`, `host_name`, and `host_is_superhost` for each result

```javascript
db.listings.find({"host_is_superhost":"t"}, {"host_id":1}).limit(2);
// First find 2 hostid to use in the following query
db.listings.find({"host_id":{$in:[65623, 440825]}}, {"name":1, "price":1, "neighbourhood":1, "host_name":1,"host_is_superhost":1, "_id":0}).pretty();
```

![image-20240407201506023](/data/assess/image-20240407201506023.png)

![image-20240407201928645](/data/assess/image-20240407201928645.png)

4. find all the unique `host_name` values

```javascript
db.listings.distinct("host_name");
```

![image-20240407204249927](/data/assess/image-20240407204249927.png)

5. find all of the places that have more than 2 `beds` in a neighborhood of your choice (referred to as either the `neighborhood` or `neighbourhood_group_cleansed` fields in the data file), ordered by `review_scores_rating` descending. 
   - only show the `name`, `beds`, `review_scores_rating`, and `price`
   - if your data set only has blanks for all the neighborhood-related fields, or only one neighborhood value in all documents, you may pick another field to filter by - include an explanation and justification for this in your report.
   - if you run out of memory for this query, try filtering `review_scores_rating` that aren't empty (`$ne`); and lastly, if there's still an issue, you can set the `beds` to match exactly 2.

```javascript
db.listings.find({"neighbourhood":"Barcelona, Spain", "beds":{$gt:2}}, {"_id":0, "name":1, "beds":1, "review_scores_rating":1, "price":1}).sort({"review_scores_rating":-1}).pretty();
```

![image-20240407204201437](/data/assess/image-20240407204201437.png)

6. show the number of listings per host

```javascript
db.listings.aggregate([ { $group: { _id: "$host_id", count: { $sum: 1 } } }]).pretty(); 
```

![image-20240407203232074](/data/assess/image-20240407203232074.png)

7. find the average `review_scores_rating` per neighborhood, and only show those that are `4` or above, sorted in descending order of rating 
   - if your data set only has blanks in the neighborhood-related fields, or only one neighborhood value in all documents, you may pick another field to break down the listings by - include an explanation and justification for this in your report.

```javascript
db.listings.aggregate([ { $group: { _id: "$neighbourhood", 
             averageRating: { $avg: "$review_scores_rating" }}
  },
 {$match: {
